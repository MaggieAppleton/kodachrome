This repo is Kodachrome – a playground for developing the Github Next visual brand.

The main thing here right now is a grid of experiments: each card opens a full-screen canvas page where I can explore gradients, grain, dithering, textures, images, and motion. These experiments are deliberately isolated so I can try different visual directions without the rest of the system getting messy.

The end goal is a new Github Next website with a lot of publishing. We'll need patterns for project listings, blog posts, link commentary, and other editorial bits. This repo is me stress-testing the visual language – colours, typography, shadows, backgrounds, header treatments, and more – before we lock anything down.

What exists today:
- Reusable control panels in `shared/controls/`
- State persistence in `shared/state-persistence.js`
- Individual experiment folders under `exploration-XX/` with their own HTML/CSS/JS
- Automated thumbnail generation via `npm run thumbnails`

How to work here:
- Keep it simple: no frameworks unless we explicitly decide to add them.
- Treat each exploration as self-contained.
- If you add a new experiment, run `npm run thumbnails` to generate its thumbnail automatically (or manually add a `thumb.png` if needed).
- Thumbnails are generated by starting a Vite dev server, opening each exploration in Puppeteer, hiding UI elements, and capturing a screenshot of the canvas.
- Do not use git worktrees in this repo.
- Do not use the TDD skill in this repo.

If you’re unsure, ask.
